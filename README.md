# Exploring Perceptions of Meaningful Nature in Nordhavn
## Context
This toolbox serves as an add-on to our report, that introduces and applies the concept of "meaningful nature" to Copenhagen residents’ perceptions, experiences, and desires for urban nature. We defined "meaningful nature" as urban nature that is not only ecologically functional but also accessible, socially relevant, and emotionally resonant for residents. Drawing on participatory mapping, photo documentation, and biodiversity data, the study reveals that residents highly value wild, biodiverse spaces—even when they are harder to access—and perceive such places as more restorative, vibrant, and engaging. This repository contains material developed for the pilot project “Planning for People, Place, and Planet”, part of the Living Lab Urban Solutions to the Green Transition, supported by the Green Solutions Centre (GSC) at the University of Copenhagen.
## Data
The datasets we were working with were collected at different perceptual and analytical levels. Geolocated data serves as a shared spatial reference, enabling integration across datasets and allowing for spatial comparisons and contextual insights. Textual and in-person discursive data often overlap, supporting thematic and semantic analysis, while image data adds a visual dimension that can uncover patterns not easily conveyed through text or numbers alone. 
## Purpose
This toolbox contains codes we used for preprocessing PPGIS and photovoice data, exploring textual data, and other material we found useful for conducting our research.
## Contents
- Preprocessing PPGIS data
- Preprocessing Photovoice data collected through the Urban Belonging/Eye-Level City App
- Exploration of textual data
- Useful resources for working with QGIS and videos we shared with each other
